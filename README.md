# NexoBot

# üîç Introduction

The purpose of NexoBot was implementing a virtual assistant dedicated mainly
to students or future students of the University of Extremadura, using data collected
mainly from the University of Extremadura, although some of the functionalities have
focused mainly on the Polytechnic School, which provides interesting information for
the students quickly and efficiently.

In the system implemented by NexoBot there are a series of microservices that
collect information in different ways, by scraping the page of the University of
Extremadura, through queries to the OpenData portal, by integrating a service that
allows you to collect information that has not been found in other services using a
search engine such as Bing, and by integrating two services that use IA to expand the
range of responses of the bot, and guide the student in a more effective way.

The bot can be used in platforms such as Telegram, Slack, Facebook, Skype, or
even from Alexa, losing in the latter some functionalities due to it limitatuions base on
using voice commands.
